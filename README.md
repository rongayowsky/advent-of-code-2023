# Advent of Code 2023

Please see https://adventofcode.com/ for puzzle descriptions.

To run these solutions, you will need gtest installed on your system among other standard C++ compilation reqs. Ideally
a flavour of linux is used. I'm personally using wsl2 with ubuntu 20.

# Acknowledgements

I borrowed the gtest/cmake boilerplate from https://github.com/raleighlittles/Minimal-GTest-Example. Many thanks friend.
